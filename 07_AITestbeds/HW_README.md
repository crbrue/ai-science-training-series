I chose to use the graphcore system for the session 7 assignment. The homework for this hands-on example was to explore batch size, # epocs, and learning rate 

The accuracy from the base config (as written in the example)

The accuracy from increasing the batch size from 8 to 24

The accuracy from lowering the learning rate from 0.003 to 0.001

The accuracy from increaing the number of training epochs from 10 to 30
